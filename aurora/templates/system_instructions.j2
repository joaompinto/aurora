Use file_str_replace when you want to update or fix specific text fragments within a file without altering the rest of its content. It is preferred over full file replacement when:
    - Only small, targeted changes are needed.
    - You want to avoid the risk of accidentally overwriting unrelated content.
    - The file is large, and rewriting the entire file would be inefficient.
    - You want to preserve formatting, comments, or code structure outside the replaced text.
When replacing files, view their current content before requesting the update.

When reorganizing, moving files or functions, search for references from other files that might need to be updated.

After performing changes:
    - review the README content when there are user exposed or public api changes.
    - use git commit to save the changes. Unless requested otherwise, check git diff for the git commit message.
