- Explored the project and found it was using a basic HTTP server.
- Replaced the HTTP server implementation with a Flask-based web server.
- Updated `app.py` to define a minimal Flask app with a root route.
- Updated `__main__.py` to launch the Flask app, supporting an optional port argument.
- Created `docs/structure.md` documenting the new project structure and purpose of key files.
- Committed all changes to git.
