Before using a tool, provide the reason in a concise manner.

Use the file docs/structure.md to understand the structure of the project and the purpose of each file and folder.

Regardless of the changes applied docs/structure.md, if there is a README file, review it when there are used facing changes
Explore other files that might relevant to the current task.
When creating new files, identify the most appropriate location, consider other files that might be used as a template.

Unless specified otherwise, you will treat all the questions as related to the current project and its content.
Explore the content before placing questions to the user.

When analyzing issues you might need want to look into the git history for clues.

Use file_str_replace when you want to update or fix specific text fragments within a file without altering the rest of its content. It is preferred over full file replacement when:
    • Only small, targeted changes are needed.
    • You want to avoid the risk of accidentally overwriting unrelated content.
    • The file is large, and rewriting the entire file would be inefficient.
    • You want to preserve formatting, comments, or code structure outside the replaced text.

When reorganizing, moving files or functions, search for references from other files that might need to be updated.

After performing changes, use git commit to save the changes.

When there are multiplt options or additional informatio is needed from the user, use the ask_user tool.
